Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

1) Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.

2) Declare function arguments - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments, and not on any global object or variable.

Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

Refactor (rewrite) the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of an array. The remove function should remove the given bookName from an array. Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName one.
// the global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

/* This function should add a book to the list and return the list */

function add (list, bookName) {
  //Create a copy of the array by using the map function
   var bkList = list.map(value=> value);

  //Add the bookName to the array
   bkList.push(bookName);

  //Return the new copy of the modified bookList
    return bkList;
}

/* This function should remove a book from the list and return the list */

function remove (list, bookName) {
  //Create a copy of the array by using the map function
  var bkList = list.map(value=> value);
  
  //If the bookName is found in the list, remove that index
  if (bookList.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {  
  bkList.splice(bookList.indexOf(bookName), 1);

  //Return the new copy of the modified bookList
  return bkList
    }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(bookList);
